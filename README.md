# Sudoku-Solver-PY
 This program will solve any solvable sudoku puzzle using a backtracking method.

The tutorial for this video was found on: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eqUwSA0xI-s

I am attempting to learn the concept of backtracing, while utilizing this tutorial as a guide.
Later, I will take the same concept and apply it to a new program.
